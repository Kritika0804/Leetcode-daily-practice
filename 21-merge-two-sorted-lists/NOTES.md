In this Question we have to use same approach as merging two sorted linked list:
​
1)Take two pointers fhead and ftail for new linked list and initiatlize it to nulll;
2)check for both linked list and  point th e minimum as fhead,ftail;
3)then traverse the linked list and update fhead,ftail and both heads as we get the minimum of both heads
4)at last poinnt the remaining list.
